Know which color of paints or markers to use and how to make a glowing effect eye effect with a white snowed weathered look for your black Zaku II.

      <h3>Showcase of a recommended product</h3>
      <p>
        This is all you need to start your model kit collection and/or very nostalgic of the anime. What we are talking about is the original Gundam, the RX-78. This classic I would say is an easy build with any pair of snippers for the plastic part runners, tweezers for the steady applying stickers (usually the eyes or head camera.), and even filers for the light cleanup for the parts. (Or snip the plastic nibs close to the part but not too close to avoid ruining the part.)
        I think it's good model for any builder at any level. It's easy and fun to build even with the model's instructions are in Japanese. But the language is very light and focuses on the pictures for step-by-step assembly. Not only does the instructions show how to build it, but you can also paint it too by checking the last page of the instructions. Having to list a color palette for you to use on the parts and would look a lot nice. (For those who hate stickers.) But paint whatever you like. So, the sculping is nice and very show accurate. Great poses references from the show you could by the pictures on the box. And kind of good on the weapon storage but recommend a small plastic bag when full assembled.
        So overall a good kit to add for any model hobbyists. 9/10

      <h3>Tool tutorials</h3>
      <p>
        Here are things you must know about building with your tools. 
        Snippers: Easily cut the plastic runners with cleaner cuts for the parts to assemble. The models come in plastic runners (plastic rigs inside the package box.) and need to be separated from them. In order to have finer quality models, you would need to have these snippers to make more cleaner cuts off the parts of the runners. 
        Gundam markers: As you build the kit, the parts need some touch up. With these parts and these tools at your disposal, you can make the models appear with more color like brighter or darker or muddy or even snowed on depending how you want the model to appear. Like for example, the Gundam Ground Type is an excellent model to have a muddy and possibly damaged weathering look. 
        Filer: Helps to have a better way to do two things. One, you can clean the parts from plastic nibs (plastic cut residue.) and smooth it out and appear of higher quality to the model itself.
        Each one of these tools are used very differently but achieve the same purpose for that nice finish.
