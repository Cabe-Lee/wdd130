        <p>This is all you need to start your model kit collection and/or very nostalgic of the anime. What we are talking about is the original Gundam, the RX-78. This classic I would say is an easy build with any pair of snippers for the plastic part runners, tweezers for the steady applying stickers (usually the eyes or head camera.), and even filers for the light cleanup for the parts. (Or snip the plastic nibs close to the part but not too close to avoid ruining the part.)</p>

        <p>I think it's good model for any builder at any level. It's easy and fun to build even with the model's instructions are in Japanese. But the language is very light and focuses on the pictures for step-by-step assembly. Not only does the instructions show how to build it, but you can also paint it too by checking the last page of the instructions. Having to list a color palette for you to use on the parts and would look a lot nice. (For those who hate stickers.) But paint whatever you like. So, the sculping is nice and very show accurate. Great poses references from the show you could by the pictures on the box. And kind of good on the weapon storage but recommend a small plastic bag when full assembled.</p>
        <p>So overall a good kit to add for any model hobbyists. 9/10</p>
